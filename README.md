The screen that is displayed is a welcome to the tamagotchi app and it shows a title with the pet.

There is a button below the pet once clicked/tapped it will take the user to the next screen.
The buttons are a custom colour so that they are easier to see and i use the color.xml to define them and implement it throught the project.

The code for the first screen is simple its just a onclicklistener that start the second main activity once the start button is pressed.

The second main activity displays the pet animal that will preform actions for the user based on what buttons the user presses and a count feature will tally the results in the circles.

The code for the second main activity is more advanced and being broken down there is a counte feature that increments the number by 1 everytime the corrispoding button is pressed

There is also all the components that are defined and assigned to there respective functions.
There is a function that keeps the images a certain size so that they do not take up all of the users screen.
Then there is the code that swaps the images based with other images stored in the drawables tab.
This is an example of the image changing and the count being incremented based on the click/tap of the play button

I had to define alot of string names for the componets and i added some image descriptions to the activity so that anyone reading the code knows what they are being used for.
